**Important Notes**
Consider that you always must keep the focus on two things in planning:

1. `Energy Saving`
   Have you ever faced a situation when you are trying to solve a problem and no matter how much you try, you seem to be not making any improvements at all? And then you postpone it for some time and take on some other activities which make you feel better, then come back later to that problem and now you see it will be fixed in no time?
   So, Set your plan based on your own energy level.
2. `Time Saving`
   We are human, So we all have some level of laziness and it can stop us from improving ourselves. Therefore we have to plan/force ourselves to do some activities at specific times to prevent that and to make progress in our lives.
